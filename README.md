Simlates the EPILEPTOR (Jirsa et. al, 2014) model, which replicates alternating states between normal and seizure-like activity. The model is simulated by periodic stimuli (at x1 and y1 variables) and features are extracted from each post-stimulus epoch. Parameters can be set so that the model shifts gradually from normal to ictal activity (changing x0), or can be set for it to alternate between normal and SLEs.
